			<b>Our Story</b>
		</center>
		<br>
		<center>
			<p>Recify was founded in 2023 by a group of friends who love to cook and experiment with new recipes. One day, while trying to figure out what to make for dinner, they realized that they had a lot of ingredients in their pantry but no idea what to do with them. That's when the idea for Recify was born - a platform that would take the guesswork out of cooking and make it easier for people to discover and create delicious recipes using the ingredients they already have at home.</p>
